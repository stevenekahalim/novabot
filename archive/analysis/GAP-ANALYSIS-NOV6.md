## SECTION 2: CONTEXT & CONVERSATIONS MISSED

### 2.1 Win's Court Vendor Frustration & Decision-Making Process

**Messages #10-13, #23-24:**
```
Win: "Interior"
Win: "Lap ini bener2 galau ak"
Win: "Rasane artgrass atau eastmatix wes"
Win: "No choice"
...
Win: "Seng menyanggupi lek menurutku"
Win: "Logistically very challenging soale"
```

**What was captured:**
```
"Court vendor selection: Narrowed to Eastmatix vs Artgrass (logistically
challenging for other vendors)."
```

**MISSED CONTEXT:**
- ❌ Win's emotional state: "Really confused" about court vendor decision
- ❌ Reason for narrow selection: Other vendors cannot commit/deliver ("seng menyanggupi")
- ❌ Primary concern: Logistics is "very challenging" for other vendors
- ❌ Decision driver: Limited by vendor capabilities, not preference
- ❌ Win's assessment: Only 2 viable options due to logistical constraints

---

### 2.2 Steven's Interior Design Decision & Progress Concern

**Messages #15-16, #19-20:**
```
Steven: "Layout pake sing kmrn seadae sek ae to, drpd 2 minggu ga ono progres"
Steven: "Bahas tema2 dll sek"
...
Steven: "Layoute sing ws ono kirimen sek ae, ngkuk lek berubah kan garek minta revisi ke dee"
Steven: "Cekno dee kerjo sek"
```

**What was captured:**
```
"Interior design theme finalized: Nature Modern. Designer working on layout
based on existing plans."
```

**MISSED CONTEXT:**
- ❌ Steven's frustration: "2 weeks with no progress"
- ❌ Decision rationale: Use existing layout to avoid delays ("rather than 2 weeks no progress")
- ❌ Strategy: Finalize theme first, then request revisions if needed
- ❌ Management instruction: Make designer work on existing plans first
- ❌ Pragmatic approach: Accept imperfect progress over perfection with delays

---

### 2.3 Critical Pending Decisions for Investor Presentation

**Message #26:**
```
Steven: "Ambek kt mesti finalize offer gae investor lokale, mau up RAB atau sing project fee"
```

**What was captured:**
```
"Need to decide on RAB increase vs project fee model for local investor presentation."
```

**MISSED CONTEXT:**
- ❌ Urgency indicator: "mesti finalize" (must finalize)
- ❌ Target audience: Local investor
- ❌ Decision binary: Either increase RAB OR use project fee model
- ❌ Implied deadline: Investor presentation is imminent
- ❌ Strategic implication: Choice affects how Apex presents value to local investor

---

### 2.4 Lead Time Question Still Unanswered

**Message #25:**
```
Steven: "Piro sue leadtime e lapangan?"
```

**What was captured:**
```
"Lead time for court installation being confirmed."
```

**MISSING INFORMATION:**
- ❌ Lead time question was ASKED but NOT ANSWERED in the conversation
- ❌ This remains an open question that needs follow-up
- ❌ Should have been noted as "PENDING: Lead time confirmation from vendor"

---

### 2.5 Architect Meeting Reminder

**Message #27:**
```
Steven: "@108835192717483 set reminder 7 hari lg kt meeting sama arsiteknya manado"
```

**What was captured:**
```
"Meeting scheduled with architect in 7 days (Nov 13)."
```

**WHAT WAS CORRECT:**
✅ Meeting date calculated correctly (Nov 13)
✅ Meeting participant identified (architect)

---

## SECTION 3: NOISE VS SIGNAL FILTERING ISSUES

### 3.1 Correctly Excluded (Good)
The following messages were correctly identified as noise and excluded:
- "Plafone yo" (Message #1) - Off-topic
- Multiple @Nova queries (Messages #2-4, #5, #7, #9, #28) - Bot testing
- Short acknowledgments: "Wes iki", "Wes" (Messages #17, #21) - Minimal value

### 3.2 Incorrectly Classified Documents
The system correctly identified 3 PDFs but FAILED to extract critical details:
- ✅ Identified: "Penawaran Lapangan padel Pak Win.pdf"
- ❌ Extracted only: Price range, timeline, warranty
- ❌ Missed: Full technical specs, optional add-ons, terms

---

## SECTION 4: DUPLICATION ISSUE

**Critical Error:** Entry #152 contains DUPLICATE content (appears twice):
```
"UPDATE Nov 6: Interior design theme finalized: Nature Modern. Designer working
on layout based on existing plans. Meeting scheduled with architect in 7 days
(Nov 13).  Court vendor selection: Narrowed to Eastmatix vs Artgrass (logistically
challenging for other vendors). Lead time for court installation being confirmed.
Penawaran received: 750-850M per court, 6-8 weeks installation, 5-year structure
warranty.  UPDATE Nov 6: Interior design theme finalized: Nature Modern..."
```

This exact block appears TWICE in the content, indicating a merge execution error.

---

## SECTION 5: PROMPT WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED

### 5.1 Document Handling Gap

**Current Prompt States:**
```
Must Include (if mentioned):
- Documents: PDF names, contract versions
```

**Problem:** Prompt instructs to include "PDF names" but doesn't emphasize EXTRACTING CONTENT from PDFs when Nova/AI reads them in the conversation.

**Evidence:** All 3 PDFs were read by Nova (messages #29, #30, #31) with complete content extraction, but only summary-level info was captured in KB.

**Recommendation:**
```diff
Must Include (if mentioned):
- **Numbers**: All amounts (500M not "substantial")
- **Dates**: Specific dates (Dec 15 not "next month")
- **Names**: People and companies (PT Wijaya not "the contractor")
- **Decisions**: What was decided and who decided
- **Next Steps**: Actions with deadlines
- **Documents**: PDF names, contract versions
+ **Document Content**: When documents are read/extracted in conversation:
+   - Include ALL financial terms (amounts, payment schedules, deposits)
+   - Include ALL parties (names, titles, companies)
+   - Include ALL contractual terms (timelines, warranties, guarantees)
+   - Include ALL technical specifications
+   - Include ALL optional/additional terms
```

### 5.2 Context Preservation Gap

**Current Prompt States:**
```
Must Exclude:
- Greetings, acknowledgments, casual chat
- Off-topic personal discussions
```

**Problem:** This guideline is too broad and led to excluding valuable contextual information like:
- Win's frustration ("galau ak")
- Steven's concern about delays ("2 minggu ga ono progres")
- Decision reasoning ("drpd 2 minggu ga ono progres")

**Recommendation:**
```diff
Must Exclude:
- Greetings, acknowledgments, casual chat
- Off-topic personal discussions
- Repetitions of same information
- Uncertain info ("maybe", "possibly")
+
+ Must Include (Context):
+ - Concerns or blockers expressed by team members
+ - Reasoning behind decisions ("rather than X, we chose Y because...")
+ - Constraints mentioned (budget, timeline, capability limits)
+ - Emotional indicators that signal priority or urgency
```

### 5.3 Pending Items Tracking Gap

**Current Prompt:** No specific guidance on tracking unanswered questions or pending items.

**Problem:** Steven asked "Piro sue leadtime e lapangan?" but received no answer. The recap says "Lead time for court installation being confirmed" but doesn't flag this as PENDING.

**Recommendation:**
```diff
# PENDING ITEMS TRACKING

When questions are ASKED but NOT ANSWERED in the conversation:
- Mark as "PENDING: [specific question]"
- Append to relevant entry with "ACTION REQUIRED" prefix
- Example: "ACTION REQUIRED: Confirm court installation lead time (asked Nov 6, awaiting vendor response)"

This helps Nova identify open loops that need follow-up.
```

### 5.4 Deduplication Logic Gap

**Problem:** Entry #152 has duplicate "UPDATE Nov 6" blocks, suggesting the merge operation executed twice or didn't check for existing content.

**Current Prompt:**
```
History Preservation:
MERGE appends to existing content. The database keeps everything.
You NEVER delete or replace - you only add.
```

**Recommendation:**
```diff
History Preservation:
MERGE appends to existing content. The database keeps everything.
You NEVER delete or replace - you only add.
+
+ Before MERGE:
+ ✓ Check if additional_content already exists in entry (avoid duplicates)
+ ✓ If updating same topic on same day, consolidate into single UPDATE block
+ ✓ Each UPDATE should be unique and additive, never repetitive
```

### 5.5 Financial Data Emphasis Gap

**Current Prompt:**
```
Must Include (if mentioned):
- **Numbers**: All amounts (500M not "substantial")
```

**Problem:** This is too vague for complex financial documents. The lease confirmation had 3 separate deposits, service charge, and revenue sharing - only mentioned in passing.

**Recommendation:**
```diff
Must Include (if mentioned):
- **Numbers**: All amounts (500M not "substantial")
+ **Financial Terms**: When contracts/agreements are discussed:
+   - ALL payment amounts (deposits, fees, charges) with exact figures
+   - Payment schedules and milestones
+   - Revenue sharing percentages
+   - Recurring costs (monthly, annual)
+   - Bank account details for payments
+   - Financial obligations by party
+   - Grace periods or payment terms
```

### 5.6 Entry Topic Mismatch

**Entry #152 Topic:** "Coaches & Community"
**Entry #152 Content:** Lease payment finalization, interior design, court vendor, project fee

**Problem:** The topic "Coaches & Community" is COMPLETELY UNRELATED to the content. This suggests:
1. The entry was originally about something else
2. Manado project updates were merged into wrong entry
3. Topic was never updated to reflect actual content

**Current Prompt:** No guidance on updating entry topics when content evolves significantly.

**Recommendation:**
```diff
## When to use MERGE (Append to existing entry)

**This is your PRIMARY action. Use MERGE for:**

✓ Status changes (negotiation → contract signed)
✓ Budget/number changes (100M → 500M)
✓ Timeline shifts (Dec 10 → Dec 15)
✓ Decision updates or reversals
✓ Adding details, context, or clarification
+
+ **Topic Coherence Check:**
+ Before MERGE, verify the entry topic still matches the content:
+ - If new content is UNRELATED to entry topic → Do NOT merge, create NEW instead
+ - If entry topic is outdated/wrong → Suggest topic correction in output
+ - Example: Don't merge "Manado Construction Update" into entry titled "Coaches & Community"
```

## SECTION 7: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROMPT IMPROVEMENT

### Priority 1: Document Content Extraction

Clarify that decision reasoning, concerns, and constraints should be captured - not just final decisions.

### Priority 3: Pending Items Tracking
Add system for flagging unanswered questions and pending actions.

### Priority 4: Deduplication Logic
Add pre-merge check to prevent duplicate content insertion.

### Priority 5: Topic Coherence Validation
Add validation to prevent merging unrelated content into wrong entries.

### Priority 6: Financial Terms Template
Provide structured template for capturing financial/legal agreements.
